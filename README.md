# My DCTL Collection

This is where I keep my DaVinci Resolve DCTL files.

## What's inside
- Tone curves (log, gamma, s-curves, knees)
- Gamut/color-space tools
- Noise & blur
- Monitoring charts (false color, scopes)
- Utilities (levels, clamp, mixers, etc.)

## How to use
1) Click any `.dctl` file in this repo.
2) Click **Raw** → right-click → **Save As**.
3) Put the file in your Resolve DCTL folder and restart Resolve.

(Everything is plain text, UTF-8, LF line endings.)
